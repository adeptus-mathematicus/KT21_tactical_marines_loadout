# Code to analyse the special weapons choices available to tactical marine gunners

This code was used to simulate shooting attacks in Killteam 2021 using a variety of special weapons. The R script here is stand-alone and the main function that it contains can be used to analyse other weapon profiles against a variety of different targets. 

**N.B. the function does not yet account for the 'relentless' special rule.**

If there are other features or rules missing, please let me know by raising an issue on this repository (or leaving a comment under the associated video). I will eventually get around to improving the script.
